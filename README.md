 Supermarket Data Analysis
In this project, we'll be performing some exploratory data analysis on the sample supermarket data. 

Project objectives
The following are the project objectives-

Performing EDA on the data to derive insights on how the profits can be increased.
Discovering the weak areas of the sales deparment in order to improve the sales.
Discovering hidden trends within the data that will allow the sales deparment to cater to region-specific needs of the buyers.
1.Importing Project Dependencies
2.Data Wrangling
In this section, we will clean our dataset, removing all the unnecessary noise or null values in the data. As the first step, let us check for any null values within the dataset.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we will perform EDA on our dataset, with an aim to uncover the hidden trends within the data which might help the superstore to increase their profits.

Observations:
The company has the highest sales in the state of California (shown in dark maroon), selling around $450K of goods.
New York (bright red, top right) is the state with the second highest sales, with more that $300k worth of goods sold.
The states of Texas (bottommost, orange) and Washington (top left, orange) end up third and fourth on the top sales charts with around $170K and 140K in sales respectively.
If we look at the overall data, we will observe that the supermarket company does most of its business in East Coast and West Coast region. In fact, the total sales in the state of New York is more than the sales in all of the Central America combined.


The observations :

The states in shades of green, namely New York, California and Washington are the most profitable for the company, with profits of over $30K.
The states in teal and blue, with an average profit of around $25K are mostly situated in the north-east and south-east region.
The state of Texas, with the third highest sales proved to be the most expensive state for the company with a very high loss of around $25K.
Now, let us have a look at the profit to sales ratio of each state. The profit-to-sales ratio tells us how much the store has to sell in that state in order to make profit.

The higher the profit-to-sales ratio, the more profit returns the store gets in the state for each sale they make.
A lower ratio denotes that the store has to make a lot more sales in order to make the same amount of profit as compared to a state with a higher profit-to-sales ratio.
States with a negative profit-to-sales ratio denote a higher loss on each sale they make.
These insights can help the supermarket in determining which state needs more attention as compared to the others.

Some interesting observations here.

Ohio has the worst profit-to-sales ratio in terms of total sales and the losses beared.
Delaware has the highest profit-to-sales ratio.
The states making the largest profits for the company, namely New York, California and Washington DC don't have the highest profit-to-sales ratio. This means that the company can further improve its sales/profits in these states.
Now, let us analyze the sales of a few random states from each profit bracket (high profit, medium profit, low profit, low loss and high loss) and try to observe some crucial trends which might help us in increasing the sales.

We have a few questions to answer here.
What products do the most profit making states buy?
What products do the loss bearing states buy?
What product segment needs to be improved in order to drive the profits higher?



Observation across each product category-

Furnitures-

If we see the average price, we'll find that most of the tables and chairs are around the $200 mark, making them one of the most expensive furniture items. Some tables go as high as USD 550 while the most expensive chair costs USD 700.
The most expensive item in the furniture category is a bookcase costing $880.
Office Supplies-

Most office supplies fall under the $100 mark.
Binders and supplies are the most expensive categories, going as high as $1890.
Technology-

As per the plot, products in the machines and copiers sub categories are the most expensive technology items.
Most products fall under the $200 price tag.
